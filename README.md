Challanges faced while writing, deploying or verifying the contract.
I had issues trying to understand the instrauction especially how to call the withdraw function from the ethervault contract. 
i also had issue with writing the self destruct contract as i was calling the wei value instaed of gwei while trying to deploy the contract. 
The strategy i used was to check the ethervault contract address(0x6dA826f51c447354f65A7480e5364672785C0417) to understand the instruction, i used the option 1 which is the selfdestruct and send 0.0005 ether and i was able to navigate the process by sending the value which i  called from my contract.
